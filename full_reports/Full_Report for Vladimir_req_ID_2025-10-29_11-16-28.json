        "Summarized similar cases": "Summary of Retrieved Similar Cases:\n\nBoth candidates emphasize a structured and transparent approach to problem-solving and communication. They prioritize clarifying requirements and success metrics before starting work, and they consistently communicate trade-offs to stakeholders to enable informed decision-making. Their workflows include using integration tests, CI pipelines, and feature flags to ensure code quality and safe deployments. Both document their findings and processes to support team collaboration and knowledge sharing.",
        "assessment": "The candidate demonstrated a generally clear and structured communication style, consistently referencing specific technical practices such as CI pipelines, feature flags, and system stabilization strategies. They articulated complex ideas with reasonable clarity and conciseness, often outlining their process for clarifying requirements, communicating tradeoffs, and documenting findings for team collaboration. Active listening was evident in their responses, and they showed confidence when explaining technical concepts. However, there were recurring minor articulation issues, including grammatical errors ('we was doing on-call'), filler words ('Um...', 'You know...'), and occasional self-corrections ('got actually sorry I meant three years'), which slightly detracted from overall polish. Despite these minor language issues, the candidate's ability to express complex ideas and maintain a structured dialogue was strong and in line with best practices observed in similar cases.",
